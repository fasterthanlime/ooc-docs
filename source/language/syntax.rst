Syntax
======

ooc has a proper module system, it's easy to declare functions, does some type inference for you, and feature generics::

    import structs/ArrayList

    main: func {
        a := ArrayList<String> new()
    }

(note: this article is obviously a stub. The page at http://ooc-lang.org/syntax
needs to be migrated here.)
